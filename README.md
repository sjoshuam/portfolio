## Project Description

This project is the "front page" for my data science activities.  The project's
HTML files form a simple website, currently consisting of three pages:

+ index.html - Showcase for some programming projects conducted on my personal time
  + Corresponds directly to GitHub repositories
  + /p directory holds support materials (visualizations and container pages) for that page
  + Links to my LinkedIn resume
+ project_descriptions.html - Showcase for some research projects conducted during my time at RAND
  + Corresponds directly to RAND reports I've co-authored and described my role in them
  + /r directory holders support materials (images) for that page
+ performance_reviews.html - Displays excerpts from my performance reviews at RAND
+ stylesheet.css - Synchronizes styling across the different html pages
+ deploy.ipynb - Provides convenience automation for generating /p files for new projects.

## Todo

+ Build containers for /r files (add automation to the deploy script?)
+ Copy edit the project description page
