<h3> This portfolio showcases some of my programming projects outside the
workplace. </h3>

<p> Professionally, I use these projects to keep my skills sharp and provide
a code portfolio that prospective business associates can view. </p>

<p> Personally, I think programming is as close to magic as one can get
in the real world â€“ datamancy?  After writing code for so many years, it has
become a favorite tool in my life toolkit.  I conducted some of these
projects for the fun of solving data / algorithmic puzzles and some to support
the various life activities that bring me happiness. <p>

<p>To view a project's visualization at full-size, click it. To see the
programming code executing each project, click the corresponding GitHub link.</p>

<p> Since this gallery showcases personal projects, you may find the offerings
idiosyncratic.  See the
<a href = 'project_descriptions.html'>Work Projects</a> page for project
descriptions for some of my professional work.  Note: the code underlying those
work projects is not publicly available.

<h3>My Travels in the United States and Canada</h3>

<p>
Years ago, I built my first model of American population dynamics.  I
resolved to see the population centers I knew so well through data and created a
list of 128 metro areas to visit. This information dashboard tracks my past
progress towards achieving that travel goal and provides planning information
for my future efforts.

<h3> Finding the Best Travel Weather</h3>

<p> To meet my travel goal of visiting 128 metro areas, I have divided
the United States and Canada into a series of travel routes (see
<a href = "p/us_travels.html">Planned Routes</a>). Good weather is crucial to a
good trip since my version of "visiting" involves miles of city
exploration walks. This project downloads NOAA weather data and calculates the
average number of temperate hours each day in each city. It uses these
calculations to predict the pleasantness of taking each trip at any given point
in the year.</p>

<h3>Redrawing State Borders to Match Where People Live</h3>

<p>
American state borders can be idiosyncratic - reflecting historical circumstances
and compromises.  What if the borders were redrawn to
match where people live now?  This project uses agglomerative cluster machine
learning to place state borders in the rural spaces between populated areas so
that states are more compact and their borders no longer cut through cities.
In addition, the project synthesizes multiple data sources to understand how
the new states would vary in population, development, and politics.

<h3>Redrawing Borders to Make States More Equally Sized</h3>

<p>
America's states are not equally sized.  For example, Texas has 51 times
Wyoming's population and 253 times Rhode Island's land area. This project
creates an interactive tool for exploring how targeted changes to state borders
could produce better state borders.  As you change the boundaries, the tool will
automatically score how your changes affect inequality among states. Note: Tool
loads slowly right now. Eventually, I will overhaul this project...

<h3>See the World with 22 Data-Driven Travel Suggestions</h3>

<p>
Who doesn't want to see the world?  However, the world is too big for anybody to
visit all of it.  This project suggests a country in each of twenty-two
regions around the world and then selects up to three cities to visit for each
country.  Behind the scenes, the project synthesizes multiple datasets with
information on points of interest and ease of travel.  The resulting list of
travel destinations won't show an aspiring traveler the whole world but will
provide a diverse and exciting sample of what is out there.
