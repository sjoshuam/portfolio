<h1 style="margin-left:10px;">Josh Mendelsohn's GitHub Project Gallery</h1>

<div class = "project">

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>This gallery provides a front page
for programming activities conducted on my personal time.</b></p> <p>I do these
projects for professional and personal reasons:</p>

<p>Professionally, I use these projects to keep my skills sharp and to provide
a portfolio of sample code that prospective business associates can view.</p>

<p> I think programming is as close to magic as one can get
in the real world â€“ datamancy?  After writing code for so many years, it has
become a favorite tool in my life toolkit.  I conducted some of these
projects for the fun of solving data / algorithmic puzzles and some to support
the various life activities that bring me happiness.<p>

<p>Since this gallery showcases personal projects, you may find the offerings
ideosyncratic.  Here are example professional projects from my RAND years:

<ul>
<li> Presidential election analysis from 2016 -

<li> Social media text mining and detection methods -

Years ago, I built my first model of US population dynamics.  I
resolved to see the population centers I knew so well through data and created a
list of 128 areas to visit. This information dashboard tracks my past progress
towards achieving that travel goal and provides planning information for my
future efforts.<br><br>

This project is 33% complete and actively under development.  The rough draft
code is done.  Next will come an improved draft of the code that incorporates
lessons learned.<br><br>

In the us_travel project, I map pre-planned routes for achieving my
travel goals.  In this project, I analyze weather data to find the best times of
the year to travel each route.<br><br>

This project suggests destinations for a US-based aspiring world traveler, given
multiple "point of interest" and "ease of travel" factors. The project suggests up to three cities to visit for each country and lists nearby UNESCO world
heritage sites.<br><br>

This project is complete.  However, changes to state department alerts may
alter the results, depending on when the code is run.<br><br>

The states of the United States have unequal populations, unequal
land areas, and borders that cut through major urban centers. This project creates
an interactive tool for exploring how targeted changes to state borders could
produce better state borders.<br><br>

This project is about 80% complete but not currently under active development.
The code has been written and rewritten several times to streamline
functionality.  However, it needs further improvements to reduce lag when users
make new selections.  Since I am currently focused on building my Python skills,
this R project is a low priority.<br><br>

Scatterplots can become ineffective or misleading if there are too many data
points because most points are invisible beneath other nearby points. This project
discusses solutions to this problem and illustrates them with a map of the US
population.<br><br>

This project is about 20% but not currently under active development.  The rough
draft code is mostly complete, but significant chunks of explanatory text are
missing.  Since I am currently focused on building my Python skills,
this R project is a low priority.  Some of the better ideas from this project
will likely turn into a new Python project at some future date.<br><br>
