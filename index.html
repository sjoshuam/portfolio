<h1 style="margin-left:10px;">Josh Mendelsohn's GitHub Project Gallery</h1>

<div class = "project" style = "background-color:#F0F0F0">

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>This gallery provides a showcase
for some of the programming activities conducted on my personal time.
</b></p> <p>I do these projects for professional and personal reasons:</p>

<p>Professionally, I use these projects to keep my skills sharp and provide
a sample code portfolio that prospective business associates can view.</p>

<p> Personally, I think programming is as close to magic as one can get
in the real world â€“ datamancy?  After writing code for so many years, it has
become a favorite tool in my life toolkit.  I conducted some of these
projects for the fun of solving data / algorithmic puzzles and some to support
the various life activities that bring me happiness.<p>

<p>My full github repository is at this link:

<p>Since this gallery showcases personal projects, you may find the offerings
idiosyncratic.  Here are examples of professional projects from my RAND years:

Years ago, I built my first model of US population dynamics.  I
resolved to see the population centers I knew so well through data and created a
list of 128 areas to visit. This information dashboard tracks my past progress
towards achieving that travel goal and provides planning information for my
future efforts.<br><br>

This project is 85% complete, with fully written rough and revised code drafts.
Further development is on hold until development on other projects has
progressed.<br><br>

In the us_travel project, I map pre-planned routes for achieving my
travel goals.  In this project, I analyze weather data to find the best times of
the year to travel each route.<br><br>

This project is 80% complete and actively under development.  Second draft code
is complete, except for testing.<br><br>

This project applies cluster detection machine learning methods towards dividing
the US into a small number of regions based on the where people actually live.
It correspond to asking, what would US state borders look like if they grouped
together people who lived near each other?
<br><br>

This project is 70% complete.  The first draft code is as complete as it need be.
I am now doing a major code overhaul based on lessons learned.<br><br>

This project suggests destinations for a US-based aspiring world traveler, given
multiple "point of interest" and "ease of travel" factors. The project offers
up to three cities to visit for each country and lists nearby UNESCO world
heritage sites.<br><br>

This project is complete.  However, changes to state department alerts may
alter the results, depending on when the code is run.<br><br>

The US states have unequal populations, unequal
land areas, and borders that cut through major urban centers. This project creates
an interactive tool for exploring how targeted changes to state borders could
produce better state borders.  The tool takes up to 15 seconds to load.<br><br>

This project is complete, but I may do some web app optimization in the future
to reduce load times.<br><br>

Scatterplots can become ineffective or misleading if there are too many data
points because most points are invisible beneath other nearby points. This project
discusses solutions to this problem and illustrates them with a map of the US
population.<br><br>

This project is 20% complete.  It is not under active
development because skill-building in Python is a higher priority
for me right now than skill-building in R.<br><br>
