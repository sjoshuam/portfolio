<div class = "project">

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>This gallery provides a front page
for programming activities conducted on my personal time.</b></p> <p>I conduct these
activities for a mix of professional and personal reasons:</p>

<p>Professionally, I use these projects to keep my skills sharp and to provide
a portfolio of sample code that prospective busines associates can view.  As a
courtesy to those viewers, I list some of the core data science skills evinced
in each project, such as machine learning or visualization.</p>

<p>Personally, I think programming is as close to magic as one can get
in the real world – datamancy?  After writing code for so many years, it has
become a favorite tool in my life toolkit.  I conducted some of these
projects for the fun of solving data / algorithmic puzzles and some to support
the various life activities that bring me happiness.<p>

<p>Since this gallery showcases personal projects, you may find the offerings
ideosyncratic.  For examples of my professional work, here are pieces from my
RAND years:

<ul>
<li> Presidential election analysis from 2016 -

Road tripping is one of my life happiness activities and I have worked
towards various travel goals over the years.  My current goal is to
visit 125 metropolitan areas across the United States and Canada.
This project tracks my progress towards that goal. A full-sized poster of this
visualization is pinned to my wall.<br><br>

The data science skills used in this project include: Writing a
decision-making algorithm to recommend cities for the list • Projecting maps,
parsing KML files, and similar GIS tasks • Visualizing project results <br><br><br>

This project suggests destinations for a US-based aspiring world traveler, based
on multiple "point of interest" and "ease of travel" factors. For each country,
the project suggests up to three cities to visit and lists nearby UNESCO world
heritage sites.<br><br>

Data science skills: Pulling data from servers
via API Requests • Fusing data streams from eight sources, despite lack of a standardized
merge key • Shaping and refining a composite dataset • Building a
multi-criteria decision-making algorithm to recommend destinations
• Visualizing project results<br><br>

IN PROGRESS: The states of the United States have unequal populations, unequal
land area and borders that cut through major urban centers. This project creates
an interactive tool for exploring how targeted changes to state borders could
produce better state borders.<br><br>

 Data science skills: • Conducting GIS analysis across multiple levels of
geography • Creating an engaging educational tool so that a public audience can
understand a public policy issue better • Building an interactive web-based data
exploration tool (shiny-based) • Visualizing data<br><br>

<div class="desc">
IN PROGRESS: Scatterplots can become ineffective or misleading if there are too many data
points because most points are invisible beneath other nearby points. This project
discusses solutions to this problem and illustrates them with a map of the US
population.<br><br>

 Data science skills: Processing data in parallel • Applying MapReduce
"big data" paradigm programming (though the data is not <i>that</i> big)
• Projecting maps and similar GIS tasks • Pulling data via API and non-API
("web scrape") server data pulls • Applying clustering algorithms • Visualizing
project results <br><br>

This project creates an interactive tool for estimating the chances that the
weather will be temperate in a specific part of the contiguous United States in
in a given month and time range.  While envisioned as a road tripping tool,
users can specify any desired temperature range for any time range.<br><br>

 Data science skills: Pulling data via API and non-API ("web scrape") server
data pulls • Conducting robust, punctuated data pulls • Generating Voronoi
decompositions and performing similar GIS interpolation tasks • Building an
interactive data tool using RShiny • Visualizing data interactively <br><br>

I held a faculty apointment at the Pardee RAND Graduate School (PRGS) and taught
R programming to Public Policy PhD students.  This project compiles lecture
notes from my class into a rough digital textbook.  The material may be getting
outdated now but still provides a useful reference for programming in Tidy-free
base R.  RAND owns the rights to this material. It is posted here as part of
PRGS' Tech And Narratives Lab.<br><br>

Data science skills: Programming in Tidy-free R • Weaving
code and text into documents (RMarkdown)<br><br>
