mistakes, and other rough edges</i>

<p>Welcome to my GitHub gallary!  Most of the code I have written
over the years is not public. At RAND, my work informed policy recommendations
for federal decision-makers, some of which can be found
<a href = https://www.rand.org/pubs/authors/m/mendelsohn_joshua.html>on this RAND webpage</a>.

My <a href= https:github.com/sjoshuam>GitHub account</a> (including this gallary) holds code written primarily on my
personal time.  I write such code for both professional and personal reasons.

<p>Professionally, I use these projects to keep my skills sharp and to provide
a portfolio of sample code that prospective clients can view.  When faced with
coding challenges on the job, I also sometimes refer back to these
repositories to remind myself how I addressed similar challenges in the past.
To support these uses, I list some of the core data science skills exercised
in each project, such as data shaping, machine learning, or visualization.</p>

<p>Personally, I think programming is about as close to magic as one can get
in the real world – data-mancy?  After writing code for over a decade, it has
become a natural and familar tool in my life toolkit.  I conducted some of these
projects for the fun of solving data / algorithmic puzzles and some to support
the various life activities that bring me happiness.

Road tripping is one of my life happiness activities.  In recent years, I set a
goal of visiting 112 metropolitan areas across the United States and Canada.
This project tracks my progress towards that goal. A full-sized poster of this
visualization is pinned to my wall.<br><br>

The data science skills used in this project include: Writing a
decision-making algorithm to recommend cities for the list • Projecting maps,
parsing KML files, and similar GIS tasks • Visualizing project results <br><br>

This project suggests a slate of countries for an aspiring world travel, based
on a number of "point of interest" and "ease of travel" factors.  The
suggestions are geared towards Americans.  For each country, the project
suggests up to three cities to visit and lists nearby UNESCO world heritage
sites.<br><br>

Data science skills: Pulling data from servers
via API Requests • Merging data from 8 sources, despite lack of a standardized
merge key • Shaping and refining a composite dataset • Building a
multi-criteria decision-making algorithm to recommend destinations
• Visualizing project results<br><br>

This project discusses 3 solutions to the "crowded scatterplot" problem,
using the geographic distribution of the United States' population to
demonstrate.  Scatterplots can become ineffective or misleading if there are too
many data points because most points are invisible beneath other points.<br><br>

 Data science skills: Processing data in parallel • Applying MapReduce
"big data" paradigm programming (though the data is not <i>that</i> big)
• Projecting maps and similar GIS tasks • Pulling data via API and non-API
("web scrape") server data pulls • Applying clustering algorithms • Visualizing
project results <br><br>

I held a faculty apointment at the Pardee RAND Graduate School (PRGS) and taught
R programming to Public Policy PhD students.  This project compiles lecture
notes from my class into a rough digital textbook.  The material may be getting
outdated now but still provides a useful reference for programming in Tidy-free
base R.  RAND owns the rights to this material. It is posted here as part of
PRGS' Tech And Narratives Lab.<br><br>

Data science skills: Programming in Tidy-free R • Weaving
code and text into documents (RMarkdown)<br><br>
