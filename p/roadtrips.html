    <p>

        Years ago, I built my first simulation model of population dynamics in the United States.

        I got to know US places and population centers very well, realizing how few I

        had experienced in person. I set out on my first roadtrip with little more than a rough

        list of a few places and boundless curiosity. Since then, I have traveled thousands of

        miles, and evolved my ambitions. These days, my domestic travel goals include visiting:

    </p>

    <ul>



        <li> Capital: Every state's capital city

        <li> State: Every state's most populous city

        <li> Population: The nation's most populous cities

        <li> Significance: Cities near noteworthy historical, cultural, or environmental sites

    </ul>

    <p>

        This information dashboard tracks my past progress towards achieving my goals and provides 

        planning information for my future trips.

    </p>
