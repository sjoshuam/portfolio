    <p>

        Over the years, I have built many models to provide actionable insights into the human

        and constructued systems that keep the United States running.  One of my life goals is to

        actually see the nation I routinely examine in my work. Towards that end, I aspire to visit

        and photograph at least:

    </p>

    <ul>

        <li> <b class="item">Capitals:</b> Every state's capital city.

        <li> <b class="item">States:</b> At least one of each state's most populous non-capital

            metropolitan areas.

        <li> <b class="item">Population Centers:</b> Nearly all metropolitan areas with populations

            greater than one million.

        <li> <b class="item">Significant Sites:</b> UNESCO-listed noteworthy historical, cultural,

            or ecological sites.

    </ul>





    <p>

        This information dashboard tracks my progress towards achiving these goals and provides 

        planning information for my future trips.  There are three data displays.

    </p>

    <ul>

        <li> <b class="item">Goal Progress (top-right panel):</b> These figures depict my progress

            towards achiving my goals. Use the slider bar to see progress counted separately for

            each region or in total.

        <li> <b class="item">Travels and Weather (middle panels):</b> These maps depict my

            past travels, remaining destinations, and the typical weather in each place during each

            month.

        <li> <b class="item">Destination Distances (bottom panels):</b> This dendrogram depicts

            the distances between cities, grouping nearby cities together for easy reference while

            planning future trips.

        </ul>

    <p>

        I consider a destination photographed only if I have (a) walked at

        least one mile in the area and (b) taken at least three architectural photographs.

        So far, I have photographed 72 (59%) of the 121 

        places on my goal list, traveling across 33 states.

    </p>

    <p><b class="item">Travels and Weather Panel</b></p>

    <p>

        The map panel on the left depicts my travels and goal destinations, as well as the

        typical weather conditions in those places.  Drag the slider bar to see each of the

        maps.  Hover over destinations (the cities) and routes (lines between cities) to see

        additional information specific to each map.

    </p>

    <ul>

        <li><b class="item">Travels (Cities): </b>

            Depicts each of the 120 goal destinations as circles.  Circle shading indicates which

            places I visited and photographed (bright, filled-in), visited long ago

            without photographing (dim, filled-in), or have not visited at all (very dim, hollow).

            Hover over each circle to see why it made the list, how many miles I have walked there,

            and when I last photographed it. Four destinations are outside the contiguous United

            States.  They are shown separately in the panel above.

        <li><b class="item">Travels (Routes): </b>

            Depicts the most recent trip that passed through each visited/photographed place. Hover

            over the trip lines to see the year, trip name, and destination for that particular

            trip segment.  As the segments show, I have visited many other places along the way to goal

            destinations.

        <li><b class="item">Temperate Weather: </b>

            The remaining twelve maps score each destination's weather in terms of average temperate

            hours per day in each month. For this purpose, I define "temperate" as having an ambient

            temperature between 50°F and 75°F. Brighter, filled-in circles

            indicate many hours of temperate weather on a typical day. Hover over each circle to see the

            typical number of temperate hour per day as well as the Koppen climate classification

            for that region. Weather maps use a different color 

            (<span style="color:#cc6699;">rose red</span>) to prevent confusion.

    <p><b class = 'item'>Roadtrip Planning Tool</b></p>

    <p>

        The panel on the right is a planning tool for future trips.  Drag the slider bar at the

        bottom to select the month in which the trip will occur.  For each month, the tool

        shows the destinations that fall in the top quartile for temperate weather.  Bright,

        colorful text and lines indicates places that I have not yet photographed, with other

        places in dim grey.

        <br><br>

        The figure uses a dendrogram format to show which places are close to each other.  In a 

        dendrogram, the horizontal length of lines indicates distance.  Trace the brackets between

        any pair of places.  The combined horizontal length of the lines between them corresponds

        rough to the distance between them. Groups of destinations that all have short-horizontal

        connections between them are good candidates for future travel routes.

        <br><br>

        The dots in the middle of each bracket provide information on the group of destinations

        that the bracket represents.  Hover over each dot to see the place that is most central

        to all places in that group, plus the number of other places in the group. Where space

        permits, this information is also visible as text beside the dot.

        <br><br>

        For example, imagine you wanted to build a road trip around traveling to Boston MA in

        June.  On the chart, Boston MA is most closely connected to Providence RI.  Boston and 

        Providence are closely connected to the two cities in New Hampshire.  Those four cities

        are closely connected to the two cities in Maine.  Those six cities are closely connected

        to the two cities in Vermont.  Therefore, you might plan a roadtrip route that passes 

        through alll eight destinations.  While the dendrogram data visualization format takes

        practice to master, it makes it easy to plan weather-appropriate, geographically-compact

        trip itineraries.
