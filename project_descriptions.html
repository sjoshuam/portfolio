<!-- PERSONNEL RECORDS -->

<div>

<h3> Applied unsupervised machine learning to personnel records to categorize
career paths; client used research to implement a new talent management
system </h3>

<p> <b> Client objective: </b> Be more successful at promoting from within to produce
the next generation of senior leadership. </p>

<p> <b> Task objective: </b> Examine the career histories of past senior leadership;
Develop a typology of common career paths culminating in senior positions. </p>

<p> <b> Leadership role: </b> Worked independently on this task as part of a larger
project. Served as lead author for the project-wide technical report. </p>

<p> <b> Technical role: </b> Applied a custom blend of sequence analysis and network
analysis community detection to develop a typology of senior leader career
histories.  Identified "missing rungs" on typical employee career progression
paths.  Typology described over 80 percent of senior leader histories
with just four categories. </p>

<p> <b> Client outcome: </b> Client implemented a new talent management program with
streamlined career progression pathways, and an opportunity-matching app.

<p> <b> Project report: </b> Client asked that the report (PR-4388-A) and technical
appendix (PR-4388/1-A) not be released publicly, since they discuss sensitive
personnel policy matters.

<!-- SOCIAL MEDIA ENGAGEMENT -->

<div>
<h3> Performed statistics analysis and A/B testing to understand social media
engagement; client used research to make social media content more inclusive,
which increased audience engagement </h3>

<p> <b> Client objective: </b> Use social media accounts to increase public enthusiasm
and meet new employee recruitment goals. </p>

<p> <b> Task objective: </b>  Improve audience engagement with a specific social media
account. </p>

<p> <b> Leadership role: </b>  Worked independently on this task as part of a larger
project. </p>

<p> <b> Technical role: </b> Performed statistical analysis on the engagement metrics
across two years of content; Designed an A/B testing plan to determine if
making content more gender inclusive would improve engagement. </p>

<p> <b> Client outcome: </b>  A/B testing revealed that inclusively boosted engagement
and the client changed their content generation process accordingly. </p>
