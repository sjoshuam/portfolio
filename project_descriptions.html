<!-- DISASTER MITIGATION GRANT PROGRAM -->

<div>
<h3> Conducted app black box testing and developed metrics to support a $1.2
billion disaster mitigation grant program; client used research to win OMB
approval to launch the program </h3>
<ul>
<li> Client objective: Establish operating procedure and win OMB approval to
launch a new grant program.
<li> Project objective: Formulate metrics to support program decision-making
and conduct black-box testing of the program's core project scoring app.

teams working in parallel. Mentored junior staff extensively on metrics design
and performed quality review on all project products.
<li> Technical role: Personally calculated cost driver statistics (Appendix A)
and conducted black box testing on the program's core app (not included in the

<!-- PUERTO RICO -->

<div>
<h3> Facilitated a $105 billion disaster recovery plan as an on-the-ground
liaison for the plan writers; the client used the plan to obtain $80 billion
from Congress </h3>
<ul>
<li> Context: Following the worst natural disaster in 90 years, Congress
required the Puerto Rican government to write a disaster recovery plan within
180 days.

cabinet-level officials and representatives from 21 agencies and stakeholder
organizations. Negotiated data access, facilitated cooperation, and provided
on-the-ground analysis to the team back at the office.
<li> Technical role: Improvised numerous solutions to enable team success despite
data availability/quality challenges and an aggressive, mandated
deadline. For example, wrote code to extract data from PDF field reports and
cleaned/curated it into a dataset suitable for analysis.
<li> Directly wrote sections of two research reports that fed into the plan:

<!-- CHILD WELFARE -->

<div>
<h3> Simulated policy impact with NCANDS datasets to make the child welfare
system more effective; client used research to lobby for the Families First
Prevention Act successfully </h3>
<ul>
<li> Client objective: Pass legislation allowing Federal Title IV-E funding to
be used for family preservation services and child abuse prevention  instead of
only funding foster care services.
<li> Project objective: Build a simulation of the child welfare system and
simulate the impact of various policy proposals.
<li> Technical role: Served as a lead programmer, building the simulation from
scratch and simulating policy scenarios.
<li> Client outcome: Research supported client's efforts to lobby for the Family
First Prevention Services Act, which became law in 2018.

<!-- PERSONNEL RECORDS -->

<div>
<h3> Applied unsupervised machine learning to personnel records to categorize
career paths; client used research to implement a new talent management
system </h3>
<ul>
<li> Client objective: Be more successful at promoting from within to produce
the next generation of senior leadership.
<li> Task objective: Examine the career histories of past senior leadership;
Develop a typology of common career paths culminating in senior positions.
<li> Leadership role: Worked independently on this task as part of a larger
project. Served as lead author for the project-wide technical report.
<li> Technical role: Applied a custom blend of sequence analysis and network
analysis community detection to develop a typology of senior leader career
histories.  Identified "missing rungs" on typical employee career progression
paths.  Typology described over 80 percent of senior leader histories
with just four categories.
<li> Client outcome: Client implemented a new talent management program with
streamlined career progression pathways, and an opportunity-matching app.
<li> Full report: Client asked that the report (PR-4388-A) and technical
appendix (PR-4388/1-A) not be released publicly, since they discuss sensitive
personnel policy matters.
</ul>
</div>

<!-- SOCIAL MEDIA ENGAGEMENT -->

<div>
<h3> Performed statistics analysis and A/B testing to understand social media
engagement; client used research to make social media content more inclusive,
which increased audience engagement </h3>
<ul>
<li> Client objective: Use social media accounts to increase public enthusiasm
and meet new employee recruitment goals.
<li> Task objective:  Improve audience engagement with a specific social media
account.
<li> Leadership role:  Worked independently on this task as part of a larger
project.
<li> Technical role: Performed statistical analysis on the engagement metrics
across two years of content; Designed an A/B testing plan to determine if
making content more gender inclusive would improve engagement.
<li> Client outcome:  A/B testing revealed that inclusively boosted engagement
and the client changed their content generation process accordingly.

<!-- ELECTION ANALYSIS -->

<div>
<h3> Employed unsupervised machine learning on voter survey data to analyze
presidential candidate support; wrote articles geared towards the public that
attracted more traffic to client's website than any other page that year. </h3>
<ul>
<li> Client objective: Contribute to client organization's public profile.
<li> Project objective: Use client's flagship longitudinal survey to produce
analysis articles on the presidential election.
<li> Leadership role: Co-led project.  Served as lead author on half of the
articles produced, contributing ideas, analyses, and programming as needed.
<li> Technical role:  Cleaned and analyzed data for each new wave as it came in.
Generated data-based visualizations to make the analyses more intuitive.
<li> Technical contribution example: Applied principal component analysis to
voter ideology questions to make a map of the "electoral terrain" and then
charted each candidate's support as "territory" on that map.
<li> Client outcome: Election analysis articles drove more traffic to client's
website than any other page that year; were cited in over eighty news media
articles.
