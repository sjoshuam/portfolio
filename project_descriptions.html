comprehensive recovery plan; estimate the plan's total cost. </p>

<p> <b> Liaison role: </b>
Relocated to San Juan for six months as one of twelve liaisons representing the
plan-writing team. Liaised with Puerto Rican cabinet-level officials and 21
stakeholder organizations/agencies. Negotiated data access,
facilitated cooperation, and provided analysis to the plan-writing team. </p>

<p> <b> Technical role: </b> Improvised numerous solutions to enable team
success despite data availability/quality challenges and a fast,
congressionally-mandated deadline. For example, wrote code to extract data
from PDF field reports and compile it into a clean dataset suitable for
analysis. </p>

<!-- PERSONNEL RECORDS -->

<div class = 'double'>

<h3> Applied unsupervised machine learning to personnel records to derive an
empirically-grounded <br> career path typology; client used research to
implement a new talent management
system </h3>

<p> <b> Client objective: </b> Be more successful at promoting from within to produce
the next generation of senior leadership. </p>

<p> <b> Task objective: </b> Examine the career histories of past senior leadership;
develop a typology of common career paths culminating in senior positions. </p>

<p> <b> Leadership role: </b> Executed this task as part of a
larger project. Was lead author for the project-wide technical report. </p>

<p> <b> Technical role: </b> Applied a custom blend of sequence analysis and network
analysis community detection to develop a typology of senior leader career
histories.  Identified "missing rungs" on typical employee career progression
paths.  Typology accurately described over 80 percent of senior leader histories
with just four categories. </p>

<p> <b> Client outcome: </b> Client implemented a new talent management program
with streamlined career progression pathways, and an app that recommends
career next steps / advancement opportunities to interested employees.

<p> <b> Project products: </b> Client asked that the report (PR-4388-A) and technical
appendix (PR-4388/1-A) not be released publicly, since they discuss sensitive
personnel policy matters.
