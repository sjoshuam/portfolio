a federal grant program that distributed $1.2 billion dollars in 2021.
<li>Led a nine-member project team.
<li>Program won OMB approval with our help, incorporated
our metrics/ recommendations into program policy, and engaged us to provide
over a million dollars of follow-up work.

<h3>Measuring Ideology Prevalence with Social Media Supervised Machine
Learning</h3>
<ul>
<li>Across several projects, developed a machine learning procedure similar to
Naïve Bayes for measuring social media user ideological leanings.
<li>Lead a four-person team validating the procedure and writing detailed user
guidance.
<li>The procedure performed well during validation tests (precision = 0.95,
recall = 0.95).
<li>Download the full project technical whitepaper:

<h3>Facilitating a 105 Billion Dollar Disaster Recovery Plan As An
On-The-Ground Liaison For The Plan Writers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Following the worst natural disaster in 90 years, congress required the Puerto
Rican government to write a disaster recovery plan within 180 days.
<li>As one of twelve liaisons representing the plan-writing team, relocated to
San Juan to spend six months liaising with Puerto Rican cabinet-level officials
and representatives from 21 agencies and stakeholder organizations.
<li>Negotiated data access, facilitated cooperation, and provided on-the-ground
analysis to the team back at the office.
Improvised numerous solutions to enable team success despite data
availability/quality challenges and an aggressive, congressionally-mandated
deadline.  For example, wrote code to extract data from PDF field reports and
cleaned/curated it into a dataset suitable for analysis.
<li>Directly wrote sections of two research reports that fed into the plan.

<h3>Illuminating Presidential Candidate Strength with Voter Survey
Unsupervised Machine Learning</h3>
<ul>
<li>Applied principal component analysis to voter survey data to measure
presidential candidate strength; crafted visualizations to make the results
intuitive.
<li>Co-wrote a series of articles to share our findings with the public.
<li>These pieces had the most web traffic of any RAND.org page that year.
<li>Served as lead author/programmer for three pieces based on this approach.
<li>Read the articles online at:
