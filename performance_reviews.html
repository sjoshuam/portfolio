<h3> Regarding Forward Deployment with FEMA in Puerto Rico and Can-Do Attitude </h3>

<p> “Joshua was a rock-star as a forward-deployed researcher for the [Puerto Rico]
recovery project.  He excelled in providing rigorous data analysis and novel
approaches to disaster recovery work and, his efforts are already having tangible
and direct impact on the citizens of PR.  I appreciate and am proud of his efforts.
He is now leading a critical task on a project that will inform a [client]
report to Congress, as well as doing critical work on [another project] – all
of it with distinction.” – Unit Manager, 2019 Performance Review </p>

<p> “Joshua contributed immense value to the Forward Team as one of roughly one
dozen RAND staff members working under difficult and crowded conditions in the
San Juan, Puerto Rico Joint Recovery Office.  This project often involved
weekends and more than 50 hours of work per week with inconveniences such as
crumbling public infrastructure and frequent power outages in addition to long
periods away from friends and family.  Despite the long hours, Joshua was
continually cheerful and always ready to help other team members, FEMA staff,
and other stakeholders.  Joshua could be relied upon to accomplish any assigned
task in a timely manner and was willing to work outside his comfort zone…” –
Unit Manager, 2018 Performance Review </p>

<p> “Joshua is resilient, patient, and has an exceptional work ethic...” –
Project Leader, 2016 Performance Review </p>

<h3> Regarding Methodological Capabilities and Creatively Turning Difficult Data
into Insight </h3>

<p> “His work in developing new ways to access and analyze social media
data ... has been ground-breaking.”  – Project Leader, 2018 Performance Review </p>

<p> “Joshua’s diverse set of methodological skills and ability to adapt them to
vexing problems makes him an important asset to RAND and to [the unit].” – Unit
Manager, 2017 Performance Review </p>

<p> “Joshua was very creative in his thinking and developed ways to best use
the data and evidence that were available.  I was very impressed by how he
jumped into a new topic and was able to apply his skills in creative ways to
develop a complex simulation model.” – Project Leader, 2017 Performance
Review </p>

<p> “He did a great job developing a rigorous methodological approach that
leveraged the heterogeneous, and often incomplete data we had to work with.”  –
Project Leader, 2017 Performance Review </p>

<p> “Joshua brings … intellectual curiosity and enthusiasm to bear in
projects.”  – Department Director, 2017 Review </p>

<h3> Regarding Leadership, Project Management, and Staff Mentorship </h3>


<p> “His work was so great, he was nominated and received a spotlight award for
his leadership and contributions.” – Program Manager, 2019 Performance Review </p>

<p> “Joshua has also been a key member of the research team for [another] project,
not only providing critical expertise in data analysis and computational
sociology, but also performing as a highly effective leader of the data
analysis team.” – Project Leader, 2019 Performance Review </p>

<p> “In addition to his research and intellectual contributions, Joshua has been
a good team player—helping the team identify and solve challenges.  He has been
a good mentor for junior team members.  And he has been a good steward of
project resources.” – Project Leader, 2017 Performance Review </p>

<p> “Joshua is … highly skilled, motivated, excellently organized, and can execute
his own research designs well.” – Program Manager, 2019 Performance Review </p>

<h3> Regarding Client Engagement and Communicating Findings to Technical and
Non-Technical Audiences </h3>


<p> “He then was able to translate these findings into outputs that are
relatively easy for non-technical audiences to understand.” – Project Leader,
2017 Performance Review </p>

<p> “…these results proved difficult to display, and once again, Joshua went
through many, many iterations to give us options for presenting these findings.
He solicited and responded to feedback as often as he could get it, and in the
end, these maps ended up being a major hit with policy audiences who received
our assessment report and overall project summary (which in a short document
contains a 2-page spread of one of Joshua’s maps).”  – Project Leader, 2016
Performance Review </p>

<p> “Thanks for all of your work on the slides. I feel like you’ve worked magic
on both the [briefing] decks.” – Colleague, 2020 email after I turned 100+ raw
slides from 3 separate task teams into a 25 slide SES-level client brief </p>
