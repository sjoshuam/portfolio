### road_trips: My Road Trips and Road Tripping Plans

This project maps out my past road trips and future road tripping plans.  I aspire to see 108 metropolitan areas across the United States and adjacent areas of Canada.  I built this project for my own happiness - a poster sized version of this project's visualization is pinned to my wall.  However, it does also serve as a good skill-sharpening exercise, as it entails:

+ Working with geographic data scattered across multiple KML files
+ Calculating map projections and arrangements for four discrete geographies
+ Generating a "data dashboard" style visualization

### travel_suggestions: Travel Suggestions for the Aspiring World Traveler

This project suggests a slate of travel suggestions for an American, based on a number of "ease of travel" and "point of interest" criteria.  I built this project as a skill sharpening exercise, as it entails:

+ Pulling data from three APIs
+ Fusing eight datasets without a reliable primary key
+ Engineering multi-criteria decision-making code to generate the slate of recommendations
+ Visualizing the project story, approach, and results
